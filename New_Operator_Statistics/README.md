# Addition to Performance Dashboard for Ignition
This project was developed to improve supervisor insight on operators. I added new data visualization and logging features, enabling supervisors to
- Monitor historical performance and trends over time
- Identify operator strengths and assign to most suitable stations
- Distribute workloads evenly
- Help reduce downtime and overcycles
