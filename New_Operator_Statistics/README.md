# Addition to Performance Dashboard for Ignition
This project was developed to improve supervisory decisions on machine operator performance. Originally, this ignition window only provided general statistics, 
and had no ability to track history or identify performance trends. I added new data visualization and logging features, enabling supervisors to
- Monitor historical performance and trends over time
- Identify operator strengths and assign to most suitable stations
- Distribute workloads evenly
- Help reduce downtime and overcycles
